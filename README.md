# RNNS-IMDB-Data
For this exercise, I will train a "vanilla" RNN to predict the sentiment on IMDB reviews. The data consists of 25000 training sequences and 25000 test sequences. The outcome is binary (positive/negative) and both outcomes are equally represented in both the training and the test set.
